Inp: anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy. anarchism calls for the abolition of the state, which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful. as a historically left - wing movement, placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum, it is usually described alongside communalism and libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing ( libertarian socialism ) of the socialist movement, and has a strong historical association with anti - capitalism and socialism. humans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, realms, or empires. with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, scepticism toward authority also rose. although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment. during the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers'struggles for emancipation. various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the paris commune, the russian civil war and the spanish civil war, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism. in the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more. anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics ; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. anarchist thought, criticism, and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society. criticism of anarchism include claims that it is\n",

      "001. Inp: autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child's life. these signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace. autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize ; how this occurs is not well understood. the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm - 5 ) combines forms of the condition, including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ( pdd - nos ) into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ( asd ). several interventions have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve the ability of autistic people to function and participate independently in the community. behavioral, psychological, education, and / or skill - building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently, as well as other social, communication, and language skills. therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths. some autistic adults are unable to live independently. an autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured. globally, autism is estimated to affect 24. 8 million people. in the 2000s, the number of autistic people worldwide was estimated at 1 –\n",

      "002. Inp: albedo ( ; ) is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation. surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity je to the irradiance ee ( flux per unit area ) received by a surface. the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface. these factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location, and time ( see position of the sun ). while bi - hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ( i. e., for a given position of the sun ), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. the temporal resolution may range from seconds ( as obtained from flux measurements ) to daily, monthly, or annual averages. unless given for a specific wavelength ( spectral albedo ), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation. due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface ( between 0. 3 and 3 μm ). this spectrum includes visible light ( 0. 4 – 0. 7 μm ), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark ( e. g., trees absorb most radiation ), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright ( e. g., snow reflects most radiation ). albedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management ( e. g., as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design ( leed ) program for sustainable rating of buildings ). the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere, its planetary albedo,\n",

      "003. Inp: a, or a, is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet. its name in english is a ( pronounced ), plural aes. it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha, from which it derives. the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. the lowercase version can be written in two forms : the double - storey a and single - storey ɑ. the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. in the english grammar, \" a \", and its variant \" an \", are indefinite articles. history the earliest certain ancestor of \" a \" is aleph ( also written'aleph ), the first letter of the phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants ( for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet ). in turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto - sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended. when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop — the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter — so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel, and called it by the similar name of alpha. in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages, dating to the 8th century bc, the letter rests upon its side, but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished\n",

    "Lithuania,[b] officially the Republic of Lithuania,[c] is a country in the Baltic region of Europe.[d] It is one of three Baltic states and lies on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and the Russian semi-exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast to the southwest, with a maritime border with Sweden to the west. Lithuania covers an area of 65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi), with a population of 2.89 million. Its capital and largest city is Vilnius; other major cities include Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Lithuanians who are the titular nation and form the majority of the country's population, belong to the ethnolinguistic group of Balts and speak Lithuanian. For millennia, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes. In the 1230s, Lithuanian lands were united for the first time by Mindaugas, who formed the Kingdom of Lithuania on 6 July 1253. Subsequent expansion and consolidation resulted in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which by the 14th century was the largest country in Europe. In 1386, the Grand Duchy entered into a de facto personal union with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The two realms were united into the bi-confederal Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, forming one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries gradually dismantled it between 1772 and 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory. Towards the end of World War I, Lithuania declared independence in 1918, founding the modern Republic of Lithuania. In World War II, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union, then by Nazi Germany, before being reoccupied by the Soviets in 1944. Lithuanian armed resistance to the Soviet occupation lasted until the early 1950s. On 11 March 1990, a year before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to break away when it proclaimed the restoration of its independence.

    "Lithuania,[b] officially the Republic of Lithuania,[c] is a country in the Baltic region of Europe.[d] It is one of three Baltic states and lies on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and the Russian semi-exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast to the southwest, with a maritime border with Sweden to the west. Lithuania covers an area of 65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi), with a population of 2.89 million. Its capital and largest city is Vilnius; other major cities include Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Lithuanians who are the titular nation and form the majority of the country's population, belong to the ethnolinguistic group of Balts and speak Lithuanian. For millennia, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes. In the 1230s, Lithuanian lands were united for the first time by Mindaugas, who formed the Kingdom of Lithuania on 6 July 1253. Subsequent expansion and consolidation resulted in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which by the 14th century was the largest country in Europe. In 1386, the Grand Duchy entered into a de facto personal union with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The two realms were united into the bi-confederal Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, forming one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries gradually dismantled it between 1772 and 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory. Towards the end of World War I, Lithuania declared independence in 1918, founding the modern Republic of Lithuania. In World War II, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union, then by Nazi Germany, before being reoccupied by the Soviets in 1944. Lithuanian armed resistance to the Soviet occupation lasted until the early 1950s. On 11 March 1990, a year before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to break away when it proclaimed the restoration of its independence.
