Inp: , among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider american - canadian network of schools, the self - managed learning college in brighton, england, and the paideia school in spain. anarchism and the state objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism. anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is open or transparent, as it still has the ability to coerce people. another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society. specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. bakunin saw the state as meaning \" coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be. \" a. john simmons and leslie green, who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely. beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ. anarchism and the arts the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others. in literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo - romanticism movement. in music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk. anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read stated that the border between the artist and the non - artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.\n",

( for more, see brett abrahams, geneticist and neuroscientist ) spectrum autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments — who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking — to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication. because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four - fifths notice by age 24 months. according to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones \" is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long - term outcome \". no response to name ( or eye - to - eye gaze ) by 6 months. no babbling by 12 months. no gesturing ( pointing, waving, etc. ) by 12 months. no single words by 16 months. no two - word ( spontaneous, not just echolalic ) phrases by 24 months. loss of any language or social skills, at any age. the united states preventive services task force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concern. the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 18 and 24 months, using autism - specific formal screening tests. in contrast, in the uk, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. it is not known which approach is more effective. screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers ( m - chat ), the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire, and the first year inventory ; initial data on m - chat and its predecessor, the checklist for autism in toddlers ( chat ), on children aged 18 – 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity ( many false - negatives ) but good specificity ( few false - positives ).\n",

    "Lithuania,[b] officially the Republic of Lithuania,[c] is a country in the Baltic region of Europe.[d] It is one of three Baltic states and lies on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and the Russian semi-exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast to the southwest, with a maritime border with Sweden to the west. Lithuania covers an area of 65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi), with a population of 2.89 million. Its capital and largest city is Vilnius; other major cities include Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Lithuanians who are the titular nation and form the majority of the country's population, belong to the ethnolinguistic group of Balts and speak Lithuanian. For millennia, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes. In the 1230s, Lithuanian lands were united for the first time by Mindaugas, who formed the Kingdom of Lithuania on 6 July 1253. Subsequent expansion and consolidation resulted in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which by the 14th century was the largest country in Europe. In 1386, the Grand Duchy entered into a de facto personal union with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The two realms were united into the bi-confederal Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, forming one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries gradually dismantled it between 1772 and 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory. Towards the end of World War I, Lithuania declared independence in 1918, founding the modern Republic of Lithuania. In World War II, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union, then by Nazi Germany, before being reoccupied by the Soviets in 1944. Lithuanian armed resistance to the Soviet occupation lasted until the early 1950s. On 11 March 1990, a year before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to break away when it proclaimed the restoration of its independence.
