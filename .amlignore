# Azure ML ignore file - this overrides .gitignore
# Leave this file empty or add only specific files you want to exclude
# Having this file tells Azure ML to ignore .gitignore rules

# Example: if you want to exclude only specific large files:
# *.large
# /very_large_data/

# For now, keep this mostly empty to include everything

/data/
/.git/
